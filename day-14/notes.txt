Part 2

From the puzzle:
Very rarely, most of the robots should arrange themselves into a picture of a Christmas tree.

What is the fewest number of seconds that must elapse for the robots to display the Easter egg?

Interpretation:
I think this is asking how long would it take for each robot to reach an arbitrary position?
We aren't given a specific "tree" to draw, so maybe it doesn't matter.
Is this just calculating the probability that every robot will be in ANY exact position?

Ah, they WILL eventually be arranged in the right way to display the easter egg.

Each robot is moving in a loop, and will eventually end up in the start position.
Every robot loops eventually.
If the robots have all completed one cycle, they will have displayed the image?

This seems like a factorial or something.

I think if we just run the thing and every robot ends up in it's start position,
then it will have displayed the easter egg

Implementation:
- Keep track of each robot in a list
- Track robot start position
- Every second, check if all the robots are in their start position
- Could probably cache the position of the robot given N seconds to speed things up
