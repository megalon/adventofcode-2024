Stones in straight line
Each stone has a number

when you "blink" they change

rules:
- stones all change at the same time
- 0 -> 1
- even number of digits -> split into two stones
  - left stone gets left half of digits
  - right stone gets right half
  - new numbers don't retain leading zeros
  - 1000 -> 10|00 -> 10 and 0
- if no other rules apply
  - replace with a new stone that is old stone num * 2024
- order is preserved. do not sort

goal:
how many stones will there be after "blinking" 25 times?

implementation:

stones = List of ulong

loop through all stones 25 times and apply rules to build new list

Might not be able to modify the list while looping through it? At least not with a foreach loop

maybe don't use recursion because we want to modify the whole list at once each iteration
